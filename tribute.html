          <p>
            <b>Jayaram Jayalalithaa</b>(24 February 1948 - 5 December 2016)was an Indian politician and actress who served as Chief Minister of 
            Tamil Nadu for more than fourteen years over six terms between 1991 and 2016.
            From 9 February 1989 to 5 December 2016,
            she was the 5th and longest-serving general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK),
            a Dravidian party whose cadre revered her as their "Amma" (Mother) and "Puratchi Thalaivi" (Revolutionary leader).
            Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers, 
            who often publicly prostrated themselves before her.

          <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
          <p>
            Jayalalithaa was born on 24 February 1948 to Jayaram and Vedavalli (Sandhya) in a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family at Melukote,
            Pandavapura taluk, Mandya district, then in Mysore State (now Karnataka).
            She was initially named Komalavalli after her grandmother. She had a brother named Jayakumar.
            Vedavalli was married to Jayaram, son of Narasimhan Rengachary.
            The couple Jayaram-Vedvalli had two children: a son Jayakumar and a daughter, Jayalalitha.
            Her mother, her relatives and later co-stars and friends referred to her as Ammu.
            The name Jayalalithaa was adopted at the age of one for the purpose of using the name in schools and colleges. It was derived from the names of two houses where she resided in Mysore.
            One was"Jaya Vilas" and the other "Lalitha Vilas".

            <p>
            In Madras (now Chennai), Jayalalithaa was trained in Carnatic music,
            western classical piano[36] and various forms of classical dance,
            including Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri,
            Kathak.[37] She learnt Bharatnatyam and dance forms under K.J.Sarasa.
            She had also learnt Kuchipudi under Padma Bhushan Guru Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam.
            She became an accomplished dancer and gave her debut dance performance at the Rasika Ranjani Sabha in Mylapore in May 1960.
            The Chief Guest at the Arangetram was Shivaji Ganesan,
            who called her a "thanga silai" (golden statue) and expressed wish that Jayalalithaa becomes a film star in future.

          <h3>Politics Career</h3>
          <ul>
            <p>
            Jayalalithaa denied claims that M.G.R.,
            who had been chief minister for the state since 1977,
            was instrumental in introducing her to politics.[5] On 4 June 1982,
            she joined the AIADMK, which was founded by M.G.R.[82] Her maiden public speech,
            "Pennin Perumai" (The Greatness of a Woman), was delivered at the AIADMK's political conference in the same year at Cuddalore
             and was well received. Even the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the Rajya Sabha member Khushwant Singh came to witness her speech which was widely acclaimed for its clarity of diction and elegant prose.
            Her seat number in Rajya Sabha was 185, which was coincidentally the same as that of what C. N. Annadurai had while he was a member in the Rajya Sabha.
            On 28 January 1983, she became propaganda secretary for the party and campaigned extensively for the party candidate R.
            Amirtharaj in the by-election for the Tiruchendur Assembly constituency in February that year.
